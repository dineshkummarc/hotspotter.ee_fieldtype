Hotspotter Field Type
=====================

The Hotspotter field type allows you to create a set of "hot spot" links on an image.

This field type requires the following:

* ExpressionEngine 1.6.x
* FieldFrame EE Extension 1.5+
* jQuery for the EE Control Panel (CP jQuery)
* jQuery 1.4+
* jQuery UI 1.8+

Note: The Hotspotter script on the master branch requires a field using the matrix field type to be designated in the field settings. This matrix field must have at minimum these 4 columns: top, left, width, height
